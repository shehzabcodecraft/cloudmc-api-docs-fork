### Search for a connection setting associated with an organization and service connection

`GET /reseller/connectionSettings/search?organizationId=:orgId&connectionId=:serviceConnectionId`

Retrieve the connection setting associated with an organization (or its lineage) and service connection. If the `organizationId` is omitted, the authenticated user's organization will be used to return a connection setting associated with the `connectionId`. If both `organizationId` and `connectionId` is omitted all connection settings associated with the
authenticated user's organization will be returned

```shell
# Retrieve a connection setting associated with an organization and service connection
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v1/reseller/connectionSettings/search?organizationId=10572c3d-16e5-450f-8af8-a01e50dc52d4&connectionId=e0133c59-cfa4-4bd5-9b49-1575aadc4842" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"
