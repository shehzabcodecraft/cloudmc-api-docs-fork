## Environments

Environments allow you to manage resources of a specific service and to manage your [users'](#administration-users) access to them. With [environment roles](#administration-roles), you have tight control of what a user is allowed to do in your environment. A general use case of environments is to split your resources into different [deployment environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment) (e.g. dev, staging and production). The advantage is that resources of different deployments are isolated from each other and you can restrict user access to your most critical resources.

### List environments

`GET /environments`

```shell
# Retrieve visible environments
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/environments" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"
```

> The above command returns a JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1ee5cd43-8395-4cd5-a20f-0f1e83b7f8bd",

List environments that you have access to. It will only return environments that you're member of if you're not assigned the `Environments read` permission.

Retrieve an environment you have access to. You can always retrieve environments that you're a member of but to access other environments you will need the `Environments read` permission.

<!-------------------- CREATE ENVIRONMENT -------------------->

### Create environment

`POST /environments`

Environments are created asynchronously on the underlying service. When creating an environment any underlying actions performed by the plugin is done asynchronously to the creation of the model, and its progress is reflected in the state of the environment.

```shell
# Create an environment

curl -X POST "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/environments" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d "request_body"
```

<!-------------------- UPDATE ENVIRONMENT -------------------->

### Update environment

Environments are updated asynchronously on the underlying service. When updating an environment any underlying actions performed by the plugin is done asynchronously to the update of the model. The state of the environment will remain in the PROVISIONED state. The task returned in the response can be used to track the progress of the asynchronous update.

If the membership mode is changed, users will also be added or removed asynchronously to / from the environment. The progress of the task can be tracked via the task id.

`PUT /environments/:id`

```shell
# Update an environment
curl -X POST "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/environments/f9dea588-d7ab-4f42-b6e6-4b85f273f3db" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d "request_body"
```

You will need the `Environments update` permission to execute this operation.

<!-------------------- DELETE ENVIRONMENT -------------------->

### Delete environment

`DELETE /environments/:id`

Environments are deleted asynchronously on the underlying service. The environment model will only be deleted if the environment is deleted sucessfully in the underlying service.

If deleting an environment fails in the underlying service, subsequent delete attempts are considered a "force delete". A force delete entails attempting deleting the environment from the underlying service and then deleting the environment model regardless of the response from the underlying service.

```shell
# Delete an environment
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/environments/f9dea588-d7ab-4f42-b6e6-4b85f273f3db" \
   -X DELETE -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"

# Response body example
```

Delete a specific environment. You will need a [role](#administration-roles) with the `Delete an existing environment ` permission to execute this operation.

```json
{
  "taskId": "1ac94e11-a8cf-45d9-ba0c-6bd7f797a8a4",
  "taskStatus": "PENDING"
}
```

| Attributes                | &nbsp;                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `taskId`<br/>_UUID_       | The id of the task     |
| `taskStatus`<br/>_string_ | The status of the task |

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Be careful:</strong> This will destroy all the resources in your environment.
