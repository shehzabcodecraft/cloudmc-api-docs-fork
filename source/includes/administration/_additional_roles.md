## Additional roles

With additional roles, you can allow users access to other organizations. You can specify a scope which targets one or many organizations with a specific role. See [roles](#administration-roles) for more information on roles.

### Scoping

There are different types of scope that you can use depending on your use case. This scope must be provided when assigning an additional role to a user. You can only give a scope/role combination to another user if you have a higher or equivalent additional role.

| Scope         | Description                                                                                | Required fields   |

| ORG_TREE      | Applies the role on a specific organization and its sub-organzations                       | `organization.id` |
| ORG_SUBS      | Applies the role the sub-organzations of a specific organization                           | `organization.id` |
| ORG_TOPLEVEL  | Applies the role on all top-level organizations                                            | &nbsp;            |
