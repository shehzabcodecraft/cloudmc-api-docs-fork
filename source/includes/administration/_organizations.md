## Organizations
Organizations are the largest logical grouping of users, environments and resources available in Cox Edge. Each organization is isolated from other organizations. It is protected by its own customizable system [roles](#administration-roles). Additionally, provisioned resource usage is metered at the organization level facilitating cost tracking.


<!-------------------- LIST ORGANIZATIONS -------------------->
### List organizations

`GET /organizations`

Retrieves a list of organizations visible to the caller. In most cases, only the caller's organization will be returned. However if the caller's organization has sub-organizations, and the caller has the `Access other levels` permission, the sub-organizations will be returned as well.

```shell
# Retrieve visible organizations
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/organizations" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"

- If the organization is a sub-organization in some organization hierachy, then the service connection must be either **owned by** or **assigned to** its immediate parent organization

<!-------------------- DELETE ORGANIZATION -------------------->
### Delete organization

`DELETE /organizations/:id`

Delete an organization. The caller may not delete his own organization. Also, an organization may not be deleted if it has sub-organizations.

Organizations are deleted asynchronously on the underlying services.

Deleting an organization is composed of the following steps:

1. Remove users from environments
2. Delete users
3. Delete environments
4. Delete organization

These steps are performed on each service assigned to the organization.

If one of the steps fails, subsequent steps are aborted and an error response is returned.

Following an error response, subsequent delete attempts will be considered as a "force delete". A force delete entails reattempting to delete the organization as explained above and then deleting related database models regardless of the response from the underlying services.

```shell
# Delete an organization
curl -X DELETE "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/organizations/03bc22bd-adc4-46b8-988d-afddc24c0cb5" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"
```

Response                  | &nbsp;
--------------------------|-----------------------
`taskId`<br/>*UUID*       | The id of the task.
`taskStatus`<br/>*string* | The status of the task.

```shell
# Response body example
```

```json
{
  "taskId": "cd921b44-ca9f-4f6b-b184-f952e5ab010a",
  "taskStatus": "PENDING"
}
```

Returns an HTTP status code 204, with an empty response body.

<!-------------------- GET VERIFIED DOMAINS -------------------->
### Get verified domains
`GET /organizations/:organization_id/verified_domains`

Get a list of all verified domains on the specified organization.

```shell
# Retrieve all verified domains
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/organizations/87895f43-51c1-43cc-b987-7e301bf5b86a/verified_domains" \
