## Resource commitments

Resource commitments allow you to set specific commitment levels on cloud resources available on a [service-connection](#administration-service-connections). This assures commitment to a specific set of resources on a fixed monthly price. Any additional resource usage will be billed on the utility price defined by the CMC [pricing](#administration-pricing). Commitments can either be restricted to a specific date range or be un-restricted with no end date. Whilst the commitment price is decided by the pre-defined [pricing](#administration-pricing), various discounts can be given on the resource utility price. Resource commitments allow Cox Edge users to receive services at fixed discounted rates whilst enabling additional usage at utility cost.

List all the resource commitments that you have access to. You can only view resource commitments if you have been assigned either the `Usage: View` or the `Commitments: Manage` permission. If you have `Usage: View` access then you will only be able to see the commitments specific to your organization. Having the `Commitments: Manage` permission lets you see all resource commitments in the system.
