## Roles
Roles have a number of permissions associated with them and are bound to users with a given scope. They are associated to users through role bindings.

### List Roles

`GET /roles`

Retrieves a list of roles visible to the caller. The user does not have to have explicit access to that role for it to be returned. If a user's permissions on a given context context include all cumulative permissions for all roles a user is bound to that role will be returned in the roles api call. 

Example: If a user has a role with `env:<entity>:read` and `env:<entity>:create` and another role exists with just `env:<entity>:read` it will be returned in the API call. 

```shell
# Retrieve all env-scoped roles applicable to this environment 
curl "https://portal.coxedge.com/api/v2/roles?environment_id=4865a023-1dd5-45a3-a23d-e952ceb7a44a&filter_scope=ENV" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"
```
> The above command returns a JSON structured like this:

```json

   "data":[
