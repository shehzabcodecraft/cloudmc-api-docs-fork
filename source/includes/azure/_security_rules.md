### Security Rules

A security rule in Azure is a filter which controls both inbound and outbound traffic on a network security group attacted to the ressource that receives the traffic.

<code>GET /services/<a href="#administration-service-connections">:service_code</a>/<a href="#administration-environments">:environment_name</a>/securityrules</code>

Retrieve a list of all security rules in an [environment](#administration-environments).

Query parameters | &nbsp;
---------- | -----
`security_group_id`<br/>*string* | The id of the [network security group](#azure-network-security-groups) in which we want to fetch the list of security rules.
`direction`<br/>*string* | Filter on the list of security rules. Either `Inbound` or `Outbound`. No value will passed will return a list with both included.

Attributes | &nbsp;
---------- | -----
`id`<br/>*string* | The id associated to the security rule. This is a canonized id from azure which is the form of `/subscriptions/:subscriptionid/resourceGroups/:resourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networksecuritygroups/:networkSecurityGroupName/defaultSecurityRules/:securityRuleName` if it is a default rule or `/subscriptions/:subscriptionid/resourceGroups/:resourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networksecuritygroups/:networkSecurityGroupName/securityRule/:securityRuleName` if it is a custom rule.
`name`<br/>*string* | The name of the security rule.
`priority`<br/> *int* | Rules are processed in priority order; the lower the number, the higher the priority. Values are between 100 and 4096.
`direction`<br/> *string* | Either `Inbound` or `Outbound`.
`access`<br/> *string* | Determine if rule is allowing or blocking trafic. Either `Access` or `Deny`.
`protocol`<br/> *string* | One of `*`, `TCP`, `UDP` and `ICMP`. `*` is allowing any protocol.
`sourcePortRanges`<br/> *List* | This specifies on which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. If the list is empty then all values are included.
`sources`<br/> *List* | List of IP address ranges or/and IP adresses. If the list is empty then all values are included.
`destinationPortRanges`<br/> *List* | This specifies on which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. If the list is empty then all values are included.
`destinations`<br/> *List* | List of IP address ranges or/and IP adresses. If the list is empty then all values are included.
