### Routes

A route within a route table for a subnet specifies a <b>destination</b> and a <b>target</b>.

A route has to be configured within your route table for your subnet to access the internet through an internet gateway.

The destination for the route is represented by a IPV4 CIDR block (e.g: 0.0.0.0/0, which represents all IPv4 addresses).
The target is the internet gateway that's attached to your VPC.
